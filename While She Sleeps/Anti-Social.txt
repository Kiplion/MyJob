[Intro]
I won't be nervous when everybody around us says, "God, we don't deserve this" and begs before they accept our fate
I want the world but I'm not prepared to work for a change
I think I'd rather be dead

[Refrain]
I'm not anti-social, I'm anti-bullshit
I'm not anti-social, I'm anti-bullshit

[Verse 1]
You're gonna follow like a freelance sucker of the next biggest trend
We're pissing into the wind, to be heard by the indifferent
Shit talker, you've double crossed your own
You're gonna suffer like a rat in the smoke

[Chorus]
How the hell am I supposed to know
"We're only human" is a valid excuse
For why my mind is polluted?
Do you want the truth or do you want to assume it?

[Refrain]
I'm not anti-social, I'm anti-bullshit
I'm not anti-social, I'm anti-bullshit

[Verse 2]
So raise it up, up, up if you're sick of these fake smile politics
Up, up if you're sick of this race we're running
What're you living for if you can't even feel it?
What is living without letting go?
[Chorus]
How the hell am I supposed to know
"We're only human" is a valid excuse
For why my mind's polluted?
Do you want the truth or do you want to assume it?

[Verse 3]
Serves you right, to justify the face that keeps you up at night
The mask you wear to cover it up and we can see it in your eyes
Serves you right, to justify the face that keeps you up at night
The mask you wear to cover it up and I can see it in your eyes

[Bridge]
I'm sick of the sound
I'm sick of the hand we've been dealt
Sick from the drugs that they tell me to take
I'm sick of the drugs that we take to rebel
I'm sick of corruption in wealth
Sick of corruption itself
Sick of division in colour, religion
When we're all the same
(We're all the same
We're all the same
We're all the same)

[Refrain]
I'm not anti-social, I'm anti-bullshit
I'm not anti-social, I'm anti-bullshit
[Outro]
Just leave it alone
My head's about to explode
So sick of the same sound syndrome
Thank fuck for headphones
